Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations.

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9.

The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Introduction\\nReal-time object detection is a very important topic in\\ncomputer vision, as it is often a necessary component in\\ncomputer vision systems. For example, multi-object track-\\ning [94, 93], autonomous driving [40, 18], robotics [35, 58],\\nmedical image analysis [34, 46], etc. The computing de-\\nvices that execute real-time object detection is usually some\\nmobile CPU or GPU, as well as various neural processing\\nunits (NPU) developed by major manufacturers. For exam-\\nple, the Apple neural engine (Apple), the neural compute\\nstick (Intel), Jetson AI edge devices (Nvidia), the edge TPU\\n(Google), the neural processing engine (Qualcomm), the AI\\nprocessing unit (MediaTek), and the AI SoCs (Kneron), are\\nall NPUs. Some of the above mentioned edge devices focus\\non speeding up different operations such as vanilla convolu-\\ntion, depth-wise convolution, or MLP operations. In this pa-\\nper, the real-time object detector we proposed mainly hopes\\nthat it can support both mobile GPU and GPU devices from\\nthe edge to the cloud.\\nIn recent years, the real-time object detector is still de-\\nveloped for different edge device. For example, the devel-\\nFigure 1: Comparison with other real-time object detectors, our\\nproposed methods achieve state-of-the-arts performance.\\nopment of MCUNet [49, 48] and NanoDet [54] focused on\\nproducing low-power single-chip and improving the infer-\\nence speed on edge CPU. As for methods such as YOLOX\\n[21] and YOLOR [81], they focus on improving the infer-\\nence speed of various GPUs. More recently, the develop-\\nment of real-time object detector has focused on the de-\\nsign of efﬁcient architecture. As for real-time object de-\\ntectors that can be used on CPU [54, 88, 84, 83], their de-\\nsign is mostly based on MobileNet [28, 66, 27], ShufﬂeNet\\n[92, 55], or GhostNet [25]. Another mainstream real-time\\nobject detectors are developed for GPU [81, 21, 97], they\\nmostly use ResNet [26], DarkNet [63], or DLA [87], and\\nthen use the CSPNet [80] strategy to optimize the architec-\\nture. The development direction of the proposed methods in\\nthis paper are different from that of the current mainstream\\nreal-time object detectors. In addition to architecture op-\\ntimization, our proposed methods will focus on the opti-\\nmization of the training process. Our focus will be on some\\noptimized modules and optimization methods which may\\nstrengthen the training cost for improving the accuracy of\\nobject detection, but without increasing the inference cost.\\nWe call the proposed modules and optimization methods\\ntrainable bag-of-freebies.\\n1arXiv:2207.02696v1  [cs.CV]  6 Jul 2022', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Mainly af-\\nter the above new concepts are proposed, the training of\\nobject detector evolves many new issues. In this paper, we\\nwill present some of the new issues we have discovered and\\ndevise effective methods to address them. For model re-\\nparameterization, we analyze the model re-parameterization\\nstrategies applicable to layers in different networks with the\\nconcept of gradient propagation path, and propose planned\\nre-parameterized model. In addition, when we discover that\\nwith dynamic label assignment technology, the training of\\nmodel with multiple output layers will generate new issues.\\nThat is: “How to assign dynamic targets for the outputs of\\ndifferent branches?” For this problem, we propose a new\\nlabel assignment method called coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided\\nlabel assignment.\\nThe contributions of this paper are summarized as fol-\\nlows: (1) we design several trainable bag-of-freebies meth-\\nods, so that real-time object detection can greatly improve\\nthe detection accuracy without increasing the inference\\ncost; (2) for the evolution of object detection methods, we\\nfound two new issues, namely how re-parameterized mod-\\nule replaces original module, and how dynamic label as-\\nsignment strategy deals with assignment to different output\\nlayers.

Related work\\n2.1. Real-time object detectors\\nCurrently state-of-the-art real-time object detectors are\\nmainly based on YOLO [61, 62, 63] and FCOS [76, 77],\\nwhich are [3, 79, 81, 21, 54, 85, 23]. Being able to become\\na state-of-the-art real-time object detector usually requires\\nthe following characteristics: (1) a faster and stronger net-\\nwork architecture; (2) a more effective feature integration\\nmethod [22, 97, 37, 74, 59, 30, 9, 45]; (3) a more accurate\\ndetection method [76, 77, 69]; (4) a more robust loss func-\\ntion [96, 64, 6, 56, 95, 57]; (5) a more efﬁcient label assign-\\nment method [99, 20, 17, 82, 42]; and (6) a more efﬁcient\\ntraining method. In this paper, we do not intend to explore\\nself-supervised learning or knowledge distillation methods\\nthat require additional data or large model. Instead, we will\\ndesign new trainable bag-of-freebies method for the issues\\nderived from the state-of-the-art methods associated with\\n(4), (5), and (6) mentioned above.2.2. Model re-parameterization\\nModel re-parametrization techniques [71, 31, 75, 19, 33,\\n11, 4, 24, 13, 12, 10, 29, 14, 78] merge multiple compu-\\ntational modules into one at inference stage. The model\\nre-parameterization technique can be regarded as an en-\\nsemble technique, and we can divide it into two cate-\\ngories, i.e., module-level ensemble and model-level ensem-\\nble. There are two common practices for model-level re-\\nparameterization to obtain the ﬁnal inference model. One\\nis to train multiple identical models with different train-\\ning data, and then average the weights of multiple trained\\nmodels. The other is to perform a weighted average of the\\nweights of models at different iteration number. Module-\\nlevel re-parameterization is a more popular research issue\\nrecently. This type of method splits a module into multi-\\nple identical or different module branches during training\\nand integrates multiple branched modules into a completely\\nequivalent module during inference. However, not all pro-\\nposed re-parameterized module can be perfectly applied to\\ndifferent architectures. With this in mind, we have devel-\\noped new re-parameterization module and designed related\\napplication strategies for various architectures.\\n2.3. Model scaling\\nModel scaling [72, 60, 74, 73, 15, 16, 2, 51] is a way\\nto scale up or down an already designed model and make\\nit ﬁt in different computing devices. The model scaling\\nmethod usually uses different scaling factors, such as reso-\\nlution (size of input image), depth (number of layer), width\\n(number of channel), and stage (number of feature pyra-\\nmid), so as to achieve a good trade-off for the amount of\\nnetwork parameters, computation, inference speed, and ac-\\ncuracy. Network architecture search (NAS) is one of the\\ncommonly used model scaling methods. NAS can automat-\\nically search for suitable scaling factors from search space\\nwithout deﬁning too complicated rules. The disadvantage\\nof NAS is that it requires very expensive computation to\\ncomplete the search for model scaling factors. In [15], the\\nresearcher analyzes the relationship between scaling factors\\nand the amount of parameters and operations, trying to di-\\nrectly estimate some rules, and thereby obtain the scaling\\nfactors required by model scaling. Checking the literature,\\nwe found that almost all model scaling methods analyze in-\\ndividual scaling factor independently, and even the methods\\nin the compound scaling category also optimized scaling\\nfactor independently. The reason for this is because most\\npopular NAS architectures deal with scaling factors that are\\nnot very correlated. We observed that all concatenation-\\nbased models, such as DenseNet [32] or V oVNet [39], will\\nchange the input width of some layers when the depth of\\nsuch models is scaled. Since the proposed architecture is\\nconcatenation-based, we have to design a new compound\\nscaling method for this model.\\n2', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The proposed extended ELAN (E-ELAN) does not change the gradient transmis-\\nsion path of the original architecture at all, but use group convolution to increase the cardinality of the added features, and combine the\\nfeatures of different groups in a shufﬂe and merge cardinality manner. This way of operation can enhance the features learned by different\\nfeature maps and improve the use of parameters and calculations.\\n3. Architecture\\n3.1. Extended efﬁcient layer aggregation networks\\nIn most of the literature on designing the efﬁcient ar-\\nchitectures, the main considerations are no more than the\\nnumber of parameters, the amount of computation, and the\\ncomputational density. Starting from the characteristics of\\nmemory access cost, Ma et al. [55] also analyzed the in-\\nﬂuence of the input/output channel ratio, the number of\\nbranches of the architecture, and the element-wise opera-\\ntion on the network inference speed. Doll ´aret al. [15] addi-\\ntionally considered activation when performing model scal-\\ning, that is, to put more consideration on the number of el-\\nements in the output tensors of convolutional layers. The\\ndesign of CSPV oVNet [79] in Figure 2 (b) is a variation of\\nV oVNet [39]. In addition to considering the aforementioned\\nbasic designing concerns, the architecture of CSPV oVNet\\n[79] also analyzes the gradient path, in order to enable the\\nweights of different layers to learn more diverse features.\\nThe gradient analysis approach described above makes in-\\nferences faster and more accurate. ELAN [1] in Figure 2 (c)\\nconsiders the following design strategy – “How to design an\\nefﬁcient network?.” They came out with a conclusion: By\\ncontrolling the shortest longest gradient path, a deeper net-\\nwork can learn and converge effectively. In this paper, we\\npropose Extended-ELAN (E-ELAN) based on ELAN and\\nits main architecture is shown in Figure 2 (d).\\nRegardless of the gradient path length and the stacking\\nnumber of computational blocks in large-scale ELAN, it has\\nreached a stable state. If more computational blocks are\\nstacked unlimitedly, this stable state may be destroyed, and\\nthe parameter utilization rate will decrease. The proposedE-ELAN uses expand, shufﬂe, merge cardinality to achieve\\nthe ability to continuously enhance the learning ability of\\nthe network without destroying the original gradient path.\\nIn terms of architecture, E-ELAN only changes the archi-\\ntecture in computational block, while the architecture of\\ntransition layer is completely unchanged. Our strategy is\\nto use group convolution to expand the channel and car-\\ndinality of computational blocks. We will apply the same\\ngroup parameter and channel multiplier to all the compu-\\ntational blocks of a computational layer. Then, the feature\\nmap calculated by each computational block will be shuf-\\nﬂed into ggroups according to the set group parameter g,\\nand then concatenate them together. At this time, the num-\\nber of channels in each group of feature map will be the\\nsame as the number of channels in the original architec-\\nture. Finally, we add ggroups of feature maps to perform\\nmerge cardinality. In addition to maintaining the original\\nELAN design architecture, E-ELAN can also guide differ-\\nent groups of computational blocks to learn more diverse\\nfeatures.\\n3.2. Model scaling for concatenation-based models\\nThe main purpose of model scaling is to adjust some at-\\ntributes of the model and generate models of different scales\\nto meet the needs of different inference speeds. For ex-\\nample the scaling model of EfﬁcientNet [72] considers the\\nwidth, depth, and resolution. As for the scaled-YOLOv4\\n[79], its scaling model is to adjust the number of stages. In\\n[15], Doll ´aret al. analyzed the inﬂuence of vanilla convolu-\\ntion and group convolution on the amount of parameter and\\ncomputation when performing width and depth scaling, and\\nused this to design the corresponding model scaling method.\\n3', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

From (a) to (b), we observe that when depth scaling is performed on\\nconcatenation-based models, the output width of a computational block also increases. This phenomenon will cause the input width\\nof the subsequent transmission layer to increase. Therefore, we propose (c), that is, when performing model scaling on concatenation-\\nbased models, only the depth in a computational block needs to be scaled, and the remaining of transmission layer is performed with\\ncorresponding width scaling.\\nThe above methods are mainly used in architectures such as\\nPlainNet or ResNet. When these architectures are in execut-\\ning scaling up or scaling down, the in-degree and out-degree\\nof each layer will not change, so we can independently an-\\nalyze the impact of each scaling factor on the amount of\\nparameters and computation. However, if these methods\\nare applied to the concatenation-based architecture, we will\\nﬁnd that when scaling up or scaling down is performed on\\ndepth, the in-degree of a translation layer which is immedi-\\nately after a concatenation-based computational block will\\ndecrease or increase, as shown in Figure 3 (a) and (b).\\nIt can be inferred from the above phenomenon that\\nwe cannot analyze different scaling factors separately for\\na concatenation-based model but must be considered to-\\ngether. Take scaling-up depth as an example, such an ac-\\ntion will cause a ratio change between the input channel and\\noutput channel of a transition layer, which may lead to a de-\\ncrease in the hardware usage of the model. Therefore, we\\nmust propose the corresponding compound model scaling\\nmethod for a concatenation-based model. When we scale\\nthe depth factor of a computational block, we must also cal-\\nculate the change of the output channel of that block. Then,\\nwe will perform width factor scaling with the same amount\\nof change on the transition layers, and the result is shown\\nin Figure 3 (c). Our proposed compound scaling method\\ncan maintain the properties that the model had at the initial\\ndesign and maintains the optimal structure.\\n4. Trainable bag-of-freebies\\n4.1. Planned re-parameterized convolution\\nAlthough RepConv [13] has achieved excellent perfor-\\nmance on the VGG [68], when we directly apply it to\\nResNet [26] and DenseNet [32] and other architectures,\\nits accuracy will be signiﬁcantly reduced. We use gradi-\\nent ﬂow propagation paths to analyze how re-parameterized\\nconvolution should be combined with different network.\\nWe also designed planned re-parameterized convolution ac-\\ncordingly.\\nFigure 4: Planned re-parameterized model. In the proposed\\nplanned re-parameterized model, we found that a layer with resid-\\nual or concatenation connections, its RepConv should not have\\nidentity connection. Under these circumstances, it can be replaced\\nby RepConvN that contains no identity connections.\\nRepConv actually combines 3\\x023convolution, 1\\x021\\nconvolution, and identity connection in one convolutional\\nlayer. After analyzing the combination and correspond-\\ning performance of RepConv and different architectures,\\nwe ﬁnd that the identity connection in RepConv destroys\\nthe residual in ResNet and the concatenation in DenseNet,\\nwhich provides more diversity of gradients for different fea-\\nture maps. For the above reasons, we use RepConv with-\\nout identity connection (RepConvN) to design the architec-\\nture of planned re-parameterized convolution. In our think-\\ning, when a convolutional layer with residual or concate-\\nnation is replaced by re-parameterized convolution, there\\nshould be no identity connection. Figure 4 shows an exam-\\nple of our designed “planned re-parameterized convolution”\\nused in PlainNet and ResNet.

The detailed coarse-to-ﬁne implementation method and constraint design details will be\\nelaborated in Apendix.\\n4.2. Coarse for auxiliary and ﬁne for lead loss\\nDeep supervision [38] is a technique that is often used\\nin training deep networks. Its main concept is to add\\nextra auxiliary head in the middle layers of the network,\\nand the shallow network weights with assistant loss as the\\nguide. Even for architectures such as ResNet [26] and\\nDenseNet [32] which usually converge well, deep supervi-\\nsion [70, 98, 67, 47, 82, 65, 86, 50] can still signiﬁcantly\\nimprove the performance of the model on many tasks. Fig-\\nure 5 (a) and (b) show, respectively, the object detector ar-\\nchitecture “without” and “with” deep supervision. In this\\npaper, we call the head responsible for the ﬁnal output as\\nthe lead head, and the head used to assist training is called\\nauxiliary head.\\nNext we want to discuss the issue of label assignment. In\\nthe past, in the training of deep network, label assignment\\nusually refers directly to the ground truth and generate hard\\nlabel according to the given rules. However, in recent years,\\nif we take object detection as an example, researchers often\\nuse the quality and distribution of prediction output by the\\nnetwork, and then consider together with the ground truth to\\nuse some calculation and optimization methods to generate\\na reliable soft label [61, 8, 36, 99, 91, 44, 43, 90, 20, 17, 42].\\nFor example, YOLO [61] use IoU of prediction of bounding\\nbox regression and ground truth as the soft label of object-\\nness. In this paper, we call the mechanism that considers\\nthe network prediction results together with the ground truth\\nand then assigns soft labels as “label assigner.”\\nDeep supervision needs to be trained on the target ob-\\njectives regardless of the circumstances of auxiliary head or\\nlead head. During the development of soft label assigner re-\\nlated techniques, we accidentally discovered a new deriva-\\ntive issue, i.e., “How to assign soft label to auxiliary head\\nand lead head ?” To the best of our knowledge, the relevant\\nliterature has not explored this issue so far. The results of\\nthe most popular method at present is as shown in Figure 5\\n(c), which is to separate auxiliary head and lead head, and\\nthen use their own prediction results and the ground truthto execute label assignment. The method proposed in this\\npaper is a new label assignment method that guides both\\nauxiliary head and lead head by the lead head prediction.\\nIn other words, we use lead head prediction as guidance to\\ngenerate coarse-to-ﬁne hierarchical labels, which are used\\nfor auxiliary head and lead head learning, respectively. The\\ntwo proposed deep supervision label assignment strategies\\nare shown in Figure 5 (d) and (e), respectively.\\nLead head guided label assigner is mainly calculated\\nbased on the prediction result of the lead head and the\\nground truth, and generate soft label through the optimiza-\\ntion process. This set of soft labels will be used as the tar-\\nget training model for both auxiliary head and lead head.\\nThe reason to do this is because lead head has a relatively\\nstrong learning capability, so the soft label generated from it\\nshould be more representative of the distribution and corre-\\nlation between the source data and the target. Furthermore,\\nwe can view such learning as a kind of generalized residual\\nlearning. By letting the shallower auxiliary head directly\\nlearn the information that lead head has learned, lead head\\nwill be more able to focus on learning residual information\\nthat has not yet been learned.\\nCoarse-to-ﬁne lead head guided label assigner also\\nused the predicted result of the lead head and the ground\\ntruth to generate soft label. However, in the process we gen-\\nerate two different sets of soft label, i.e., coarse label and\\nﬁne label, where ﬁne label is the same as the soft label gen-\\nerated by lead head guided label assigner, and coarse label\\nis generated by allowing more grids to be treated as posi-\\ntive target by relaxing the constraints of the positive sample\\nassignment process. The reason for this is that the learning\\nability of an auxiliary head is not as strong as that of a lead\\nhead, and in order to avoid losing the information that needs\\nto be learned, we will focus on optimizing the recall of aux-\\niliary head in the object detection task. As for the output\\nof lead head, we can ﬁlter the high precision results from\\nthe high recall results as the ﬁnal output. However, we must\\nnote that if the additional weight of coarse label is close to\\n5', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Other trainable bag-of-freebies\\nIn this section we will list some trainable bag-of-\\nfreebies. These freebies are some of the tricks we used\\nin training, but the original concepts were not proposed\\nby us. The training details of these freebies will be elab-\\norated in the Appendix, including (1) Batch normalization\\nin conv-bn-activation topology: This part mainly connects\\nbatch normalization layer directly to convolutional layer.\\nThe purpose of this is to integrate the mean and variance\\nof batch normalization into the bias and weight of convolu-\\ntional layer at the inference stage. (2) Implicit knowledge\\nin YOLOR [81] combined with convolution feature map in\\naddition and multiplication manner: Implicit knowledge in\\nYOLOR can be simpliﬁed to a vector by pre-computing at\\nthe inference stage. This vector can be combined with the\\nbias and weight of the previous or subsequent convolutional\\nlayer. (3) EMA model: EMA is a technique used in mean\\nteacher [75], and in our system we use EMA model purely\\nas the ﬁnal inference model.5. Experiments\\n5.1. Experimental setup\\nWe use Microsoft COCO dataset to conduct experiments\\nand validate our object detection method. All our experi-\\nments did not use pre-trained models. That is, all models\\nwere trained from scratch. During the development pro-\\ncess, we used train 2017 set for training, and then used val\\n2017 set for veriﬁcation and choosing hyperparameters. Fi-\\nnally, we show the performance of object detection on the\\ntest 2017 set and compare it with the state-of-the-art object\\ndetection algorithms. Detailed training parameter settings\\nare described in Appendix.\\nWe designed basic model for edge GPU, normal GPU,\\nand cloud GPU, and they are respectively called YOLOv7-\\ntiny, YOLOv7, and YOLOv7-W6. At the same time, we\\nalso use basic model for model scaling for different ser-\\nvice requirements and get different types of models. For\\nYOLOv7, we do stack scaling on neck, and use the pro-\\nposed compound scaling method to perform scaling-up of\\nthe depth and width of the entire model, and use this to ob-\\ntain YOLOv7-X. As for YOLOv7-W6, we use the newly\\nproposed compound scaling method to obtain YOLOv7-E6\\nand YOLOv7-D6. In addition, we use the proposed E-\\nELAN for YOLOv7-E6, and thereby complete YOLOv7-\\nE6E. Since YOLOv7-tiny is an edge GPU-oriented archi-\\ntecture, it will use leaky ReLU as activation function. As\\nfor other models we use SiLU as activation function.

We show\\nall comparison results in Table 6. From the results listed in\\nTable 6, it is clear that any model that increases assistant\\nloss can signiﬁcantly improve the overall performance. In\\naddition, our proposed lead guided label assignment strat-\\negy receives better performance than the general indepen-\\ndent label assignment strategy in AP, AP 50, and AP 75. As\\nfor our proposed coarse for assistant and ﬁne for lead label\\nassignment strategy, it results in best results in all cases. In\\nFigure 8 we show the objectness map predicted by different\\nmethods at auxiliary head and lead head. From Figure 8 we\\nﬁnd that if auxiliary head learns lead guided soft label, it\\nwill indeed help lead head to extract the residual informa-\\ntion from the consistant targets.\\nTable 6: Ablation study on proposed auxiliary head.\\nModel Size APvalAPval\\n50APval\\n75\\nbase (v7-E6) 1280 55.6% 73.2% 60.7%\\nindependent 1280 55.8% 73.4% 60.9%\\nlead guided 1280 55.9% 73.5% 61.0%\\ncoarse-to-ﬁne lead guided 1280 55.9% 73.5% 61.1%\\nimprovement - +0.3 +0.3 +0.4\\nIn Table 7 we further analyze the effect of the proposed\\ncoarse-to-ﬁne lead guided label assignment method on the\\ndecoder of auxiliary head. That is, we compared the results\\nof with/without the introduction of upper bound constraint.\\nJudging from the numbers in the Table, the method of con-\\nstraining the upper bound of objectness by the distance from\\nthe center of the object can achieve better performance.\\nTable 7: Ablation study on constrained auxiliary head.\\nModel Size APvalAPval\\n50APval\\n75\\nbase (v7-E6) 1280 55.6% 73.2% 60.7%\\naux without constraint 1280 55.9% 73.5% 61.0%\\naux with constraint 1280 55.9% 73.5% 61.1%\\nimprovement - +0.3 +0.3 +0.4Since the proposed YOLOv7 uses multiple pyramids to\\njointly predict object detection results, we can directly con-\\nnect auxiliary head to the pyramid in the middle layer for\\ntraining. This type of training can make up for informa-\\ntion that may be lost in the next level pyramid prediction.\\nFor the above reasons, we designed partial auxiliary head\\nin the proposed E-ELAN architecture. Our approach is to\\nconnect auxiliary head after one of the sets of feature map\\nbefore merging cardinality, and this connection can make\\nthe weight of the newly generated set of feature map not\\ndirectly updated by assistant loss. Our design allows each\\npyramid of lead head to still get information from objects\\nwith different sizes. Table 8 shows the results obtained us-\\ning two different methods, i.e., coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided\\nand partial coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided methods. Obviously,\\nthe partial coarse-to-ﬁne lead guided method has a better\\nauxiliary effect.\\nTable 8: Ablation study on partial auxiliary head.\\nModel Size APvalAPval\\n50APval\\n75\\nbase (v7-E6E) 1280 56.3% 74.0% 61.5%\\naux 1280 56.5% 74.0% 61.6%\\npartial aux 1280 56.8% 74.4% 62.1%\\nimprovement - +0.5 +0.4 +0.6\\n6. Conclusions\\nIn this paper we propose a new architecture of real-\\ntime object detector and the corresponding model scaling\\nmethod. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the evolving process\\nof object detection methods generates new research top-\\nics. During the research process, we found the replace-\\nment problem of re-parameterized module and the alloca-\\ntion problem of dynamic label assignment. To solve the\\nproblem, we propose the trainable bag-of-freebies method\\nto enhance the accuracy of object detection. Based on the\\nabove, we have developed the YOLOv7 series of object de-\\ntection systems, which receives the state-of-the-art results.\\n7.
